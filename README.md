# Cardboard Dungeon

[Play it on Github IO Here](http://chrismwaite.github.io/cardboard-dungeon/)

Cardboard Dungeon is an experimental virtual reality dungeon crawling experience. It is designed for use with [Google's Cardboard VR headset](https://www.google.com/get/cardboard).

Cardboard Dungeon utilises the [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) VR framework by Mozilla.

You can read a series of devlogs about its creation [here](http://www.bytesizeadventures.com/cardboard-dungeon-devlog-4/).

The VR team at Mozilla asked if I'd like to write a case study for their Mozilla Hacks blog. [You can read that here](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/03/building-cardboard-dungeon-with-a-frame/).

## Setup

1. Navigate to the [game](http://chrismwaite.github.io/cardboard-dungeon/) in your phone's web browser
2. Tap the Google Cardboard icon in the bottom right
3. Place your phone in your Google Cardboard headset
4. Explore the dungeon!

## How to play

All interaction in Cardboard Dungeon utilises the "Gaze" interaction method. Looking at an object for a short period of time will trigger an interaction if one is available. The cursor will shrink to indicate that a "Gaze" has been triggered.

Gaze at the blue spheres to move around the dungeon. The spheres will telport you to their location.

At your feet is a compass and an inventory. Gazing at the compass will open and close the inventory. Any items you have collected will appear in the slots in your inventory (only visible when the inventory is open). You can wield items by gazing at the item in your inventory. Gazing again will remove the item from your hand.

Gazing at items will pick them up and place them in your inventory.

Gazing at some objects with an item in your hand will trigger an interaction.
